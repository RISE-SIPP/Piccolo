bootrom copied from [BESSPIN-GFE repository](https://github.com/GaloisInc/BESSPIN-GFE).

Given that this Piccolo project is to be implemented in the Arty A7 100T board, the following modification were made to the original file:

1. Makefile:
`NO_PCI=1 / CPU_SPEED=25000000`
2. `bootrom.S`:
`#define BOOT_START 0x40400000`
